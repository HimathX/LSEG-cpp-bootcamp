# LSEG C++ Bootcamp 2026 🚀

A comprehensive collection of materials, notes, and projects from the **LSEG High-Performance C++ Workshop** conducted over 12 weeks (January - April 2026).

## 📋 About the Workshop

This workshop is a collaboration between LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) and my university, focusing on high-performance C++ programming for mission-critical applications. The program covers everything from C++ fundamentals to advanced topics like concurrent programming and design patterns.

**Duration:** 12 weeks (Jan 29, 2026 - Apr 2026)  
**Format:** Virtual sessions (Zoom) + Final on-site visit  
**Schedule:** Every Thursday at 10:15 AM
